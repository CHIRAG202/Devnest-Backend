Redis is not a database, is just to store large JSON file, it consist of key ans value pair. It is used for catching purposes. It is stored in RAM.


SET name anjali (set/create key anjali)


GET name  


DEL name  


KEYS *


EXISTS name


FLUSHALL(delete everything)


ttl name(get the remaining time of key expiry in seconds)


Expire name 10(will expire the key in 10 sec)   -2 defines that key has been expired


Setex name 10 anjali (set name along with expiry)

 
lpush(pushing at  extreme left )


rpush(pushing at  extreme right)


[ lpush name key ]


[rpush name key]



üî•NOTE :-> PostgreSQL is a relational database, first and foremost, whereas Redis is a key-value store.
That said, you could use PostgreSQL as a key-value store, simply because many relational database products do not dictate that you use the relational model



üèÅPostgreSQL (pronounced as post-gress-Q-L) is an open source relational database management system

POSTGRESQL INIT COMMANDS :
sudo service postgresql start
psql -U postgres

CREATE DATABASE devs;                               [DON'T FORGET TO ADD ; üî¥]
